# Pinia Clicker Demo

(Article link coming soon).

This is a demo that shows one way you can use
Pinia to manage game state for incremental games. 

I've found that Pinia is a great way to manage state in 
experiences crafted with Vue, and by leveraging types from 
Typescript, you can create a fairly robust relationship 
between your game's state and how you present it. 

## Running the demo

**Play it online**
